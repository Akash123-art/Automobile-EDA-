# 🚗 Automobile Dataset EDA

## 🔍 Project Overview
This project explores and analyzes the Automobile dataset using Python. The goal is to uncover key insights related to car prices, performance, fuel types, and design features using data visualizations and regression techniques.

## 📁 Dataset
- Source: [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/automobile)
- Records: 200+ car models
- Features: Price, engine size, horsepower, fuel type, body style, number of doors, etc.

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-learn (Linear Regression)
- SQLite (optional for queries)

## 📊 Key Analyses
- Correlation heatmap between price & features
- Fuel type vs car price (boxplot)
- Price vs horsepower (scatter plot)
- Body style distribution
- Missing value handling and data cleaning

## 🧠 Bonus: Linear Regression Model
- Trained a basic model to predict `price` from horsepower, engine-size, and curb-weight.
- Evaluated using R² and RMSE metrics.

## 📌 Sample Insights
- Larger engine size → higher price
- Diesel cars generally cost more
- Two-door sporty models have a wider price range
